# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**webscrapper-ai** is a project focused on training a model for OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) web extraction, branded under the name "Advuman." The project is currently in its early/documentation phase (Phase 0) — there is no application code yet.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` — PDF documents containing business plans, SOPs, OSINT source guides, sprint plans, and research foundations for various UK trade lanes (India, Vietnam, Egypt)
- `README.md` — Minimal project description

## Current State

The repository contains only planning and research documentation (PDFs). No build system, dependencies, tests, or application code exist yet. Future development will likely involve web scraping and OSINT data extraction tooling.
